# smtp-keylogger
a little modification to the ftp keylogger. just using mails to get keys now.
the code is also kinda short. googled most of the codes and this is just one of my mini projects.
feel free to review and provide feedback.
now for those who said ftp keylogger didn't work, this will surely work.
